# SQLify 🚀

Introducing SQLify, our AI-powered tool designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between human language and complex database queries. Revolutionizing data retrieval, SQLify enables users to effortlessly pose questions in natural language, transforming them into precise SQL queries for efficient database interrogation.

## Overview 🌐

This is an end-to-end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. We are building a system that can talk to SQL databases. Users ask questions in natural language, and the system generates answers by converting those questions into an SQL query and then executing that query on an SQL database.

## Project Highlights 🌟

- We will build an LLM-based question and answer system using:
  - Google Palm LLM 🌴
  - Hugging Face embeddings 🤗
  - Streamlit for UI 🚀
  - Langchain framework 🛠️
  - Chromadb as a vector store 🧬
  - Few-shot learning 📚

In the UI, users can ask questions in natural language, and SQLify will produce the answers.
